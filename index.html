WILUG(7)		   Internet Reference Manual		      WILUG(7)

<a name="name"><em>NAME</em></a>
        <span class="cmd">wilug</span> - Wisconsin Linux Users' Group

<a name="synopsis"><em>SYNOPSIS</em></a>
        <span class="cmd">wilug</span> {<span class="arg">thing</span>} [<span class="arg">other stuff if you want</span>...]

<a name="description"><em>DESCRIPTION</em></a>
        WILUG doesn't really exist; it's basically an online cesspool
        inhabited by members of real Wisconsin Linux and Unix groups (see 
        <a href="#seealso">SEE ALSO</a>). It's like an umbrella, but turned upside down and 
        filled with radioactive lollipops and <a href="http://newlug.org/pipermail/newlug/2006-February/002491.html">eliteists</a>.

        <span class="arg">thing</span> may be one of the following options:

        <a href="#">irc</a>     We hang out on <a href="http://freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a> in the channel <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/wilug">#wilug</a>. 
                <a href="http://newlug.org/wilug-stats/">Statistics</a> for the channel are also available.

        <a href="#">http</a>    You're already here.

        All <span class="arg">other stuff</span> will be silently ignored.

    <span class=section><strong>Presentations</strong></span>
        spinal4ever recently gave a <a href="talks/spinal4ever.html">talk on Oracle security</a>.

        We've also had a series of '<a href="talks/lightning.html">lightning talks</a>' on a variety of 
        technical subjects.

        There are some other 'things' on the internet that seem as if they
        might be WILUG:
            
            http://www.freelists.org/list/wislug

        These 'things' are <em>not</em> WILUG. There can only be one fake pan-
        Wisconsin Linux/Unix/BSD group, and this is it. Look at us; don't look
        at them.

<a name="history"><em>HISTORY</em></a>
        #wilug was created on irc.freenode.net by lt_kije on 30 January, 2006.
        Nobody really used it at first: #madlug and #newlug seemed good
        enough. But then, lo, the conversations became disjointed and rizbot
        became a bug. So we <a href="madlug2wilug.html">merged</a> on 20 December, 2006.

        A domain name (wilug.us) and web page were added on 1 January, 2007.

        On 2 January, 2007, a transparent and democratic vote lead to an
        undesirable outcome so lt_kije arbitrarily chose 30 January as the
        official birthday of the various WILUG entities. 

        On 30 January, 2007, in honor of The Birthday, sargeantd procured and
        donated wilug.org for the exclusive use of WILUG. sargeantd was then
        promoted to sergeant.

<a name="bugs"><em>BUGS</em></a>
        rizbot, freenode.
