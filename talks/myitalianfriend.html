        [10:28]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	otay: you still need to know the SID or service name of that instance
        [10:28]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	tablespace isn't relevant at all
        [10:28]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	otay: google around for OracleNet basics
        [10:28]	&lt;otay&gt;	sid is iserv
        [10:29]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	then you could connect with EasyConnect (I think that's the name)
        [10:29]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	or add an entry in your tnsnames.ora file either manually or via one of the two java utilities
        [10:29]	&lt;otay&gt;	easyconnect? i have downloaded oracle sql plus express client
        [10:29]	&lt;otay&gt;	i will use this.
        [10:30]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	then go nuts
        [10:30]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	I've no experience with express clients
        [10:31]	&lt;otay&gt;	rizzo: i have experience with a big penis and your mother under my desk. if you need RTFM dont google, just ask me .. i am your mother skilled developer.

        [10:31]	&lt;Xgc&gt;	I don't know if the installation process is any better. A few years ago it lacked any setup for the network related config files (like tnsnames.ora or the libs). Be careful here.

        [10:33]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	you're telling *ME* to rtfm? you're the one who was asking how to connect to the DB.
        [10:33]	&lt;Xgc&gt;	Once you set up the instant client properly, it'll be fine. But the config might not be done for you and may not be specified in the docs.
        [10:33]	&lt;otay&gt;	rizzo: i cant now explain you all the oracle stuff.. please google .. and learn how to logon i guess is : connect user/pass@host

        [10:39]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	someone please show me where I insulted him
        [10:39]	&lt;rizzo&gt;	my irc client must be hiding it from me
